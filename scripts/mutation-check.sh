# Mutation check for the query path (spec §6).
#
# Each entry breaks one load-bearing behaviour and runs the suite. A
# mutation that SURVIVES is a branch no test can see — the suite is green
# whether that code is right or wrong.
#
# This exists because five rounds of code review found silent defects the
# suite could not see, and the fixture was the reason every time: reviews
# find what the fixture makes reachable. Reading the tests never revealed
# that; twenty minutes of mutation did. Run it after touching the
# compiler, the scope lowering, as-of routing, publish, or the grain
# vocabulary, and treat a SURVIVED line as a missing test rather than a
# curiosity.
#
# The two source-time tie-break entries were described as "caught
# probabilistically, because the tests loop twenty times". Measured, that
# reasoning was wrong: the query plan is deterministic within a process,
# so twenty iterations sample one answer twenty times rather than twenty
# times independently. The as-of entry survived two runs in three.
#
# What fixes it is the fixture, not the loop. Eight tied generations
# instead of two, with the winner inserted first, makes an unordered pick
# land on the wrong row every time rather than half the time: 4/4 caught
# after, 1/3 before. The retention entry measured 3/3 as it stood and was
# left alone. Neither is probabilistic now — treat a SURVIVED on either as
# a real finding.
#
# This script edits tracked source files in place and restores them
# afterwards, so it takes three precautions.
#
#   * The backup path is unique per run. A single shared /tmp path let two
#     concurrent runs restore each other's backup over the wrong file, and
#     one checkout ended up with the contents of scope_sql.rs inside
#     compile.rs.
#   * A lock directory serialises runs against the same checkout, because
#     two runs mutating the same files cannot both be meaningful anyway.
#   * A trap restores the file in flight however the script exits, so an
#     interrupt or a stale anchor cannot leave a mutation in the tree. An
#     earlier abort did exactly that, and the mutation was found committed
#     to a working tree days later.
#
# Usage: zsh scripts/mutation-check.sh [substring]   (from the repo root)
#
# With a substring, only entries whose name contains it are run — for
# iterating on the entries you just added. Always finish with an unfiltered
# run; a filtered one proves nothing about the rest.

# No entry for the UInt16 arm of concat_preserving_dictionaries. Removing
# it falls back to arrow's own concat, which — measured, not assumed —
# unifies the shared dictionary to the same result. It is a speed
# optimization at arrow 58.4.0, so a mutation of it has no behaviour for a
# test to catch, and an entry here would only ever report SURVIVED. The
# shared-dictionary path's actual behaviour is covered below.
