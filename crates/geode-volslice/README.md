# geode-volslice

The vol slice viewer tile: one underlying's volatility smiles, one curve per
expiry and per kind, read from the CVI document, a link group's draft and the
option chain. Every vol, coordinate and density it paints comes out of the
data tier's vol door; the crate computes none of them.

## Module map

- `content.rs`: `VolsliceFactory` (kind `volslice`, accepts `underlying_ref`,
  launch table `{ underlying = "<u>" }`), the tile's `TileContent` door
  (`follows()` is `true`), `ACTIONS` and the `DEFAULT_KEYMAP` fragment.
- `core/`: pure state, tested without gpui.
- `tile/`: the hosted entity and its tests.

## Invariants

- The key context does not opt into counts: the bare digits are kind
  toggles, and a counting context would swallow them.
