//! The `Domain::Views` adapter (spec §8.1): the doc views live in, and
//! the one-line summary a view's browse row shows.
//!
//! One module per domain, holding that domain's own functions and
//! nothing else (spec §4) — the scaffold matches on `Domain` exactly
//! once per function, so an adapter never learns about the stage
//! machine, the key vocabulary or the markers, and the markers never
//! learn about views.
//!
//! Views goes first on purpose (spec §14). It is the only domain whose
//! edit stage has to split one list of columns across two destinations —
//! order, inclusion and width to `view_presentation.toml`, the column
//! set itself to `views.toml` — so building it first settles the
//! vocabulary before three thinner adapters depend on it.
