# Performance measurement infrastructure

What exists today for spec §7.4 ("Enforcement"), and what is deliberately
deferred. PHILOSOPHY.md §6 is the governing rule: performance is a
discipline, measured before and after, with budgets treated as contracts.

## Frame-time histogram (always compiled)

`geode_shell::perf::FrameHistogram` — a fixed-size log-bucket histogram
(12 buckets/decade over 0.1ms→100ms, plus overflow; saturating counters;
approximate percentiles capped at the observed max). `ShellView` owns one
and records into it at the top of every `render`:

- **Signal**: the interval between consecutive `ShellView::render` calls.
  Geode is event-driven, so during interaction bursts (key-repeat,
  drags, typing) consecutive samples are honest frame times including the
  previous frame's full prepaint/paint/present. It does **not** capture
  compositor/display latency, frames where only a child entity
  re-rendered, or the duration of the last render before an idle pause;
  intervals ≥ 500ms (`perf::IDLE_CUTOFF`) are counted as idle gaps, never
  recorded as frames.
- **Discipline**: recording is O(1), allocation-free, lock-free, and
  never notifies — instrumentation cannot force frames or stall the
  render thread it measures.

## Debug overlay (`perf::toggle_overlay`, bound `mod+shift+p`)

A palette-style instant panel (top-right, theme tokens, category
"Diagnostics" in the palette) showing frames-since-reset and p50/p95/max
frame time. `perf::reset` (palette-only) zeroes the counters. The overlay
adds **no timer**: values are as-of the last invalidation — anything that
redraws the window refreshes it, and an idle shell honestly shows the
stats from its last painted frame rather than waking up to animate them.

## Benchmarks

- `cargo bench -p geode-shell` — criterion over the pure shell cores
  (`benches/shell_cores.rs`): `Tree::layout` and `divider_strips` on
  deep/wide trees at 10/40/100 tiles, `resolve_drop_target` cursor
  sweep, `Matcher::press` worst-case no-match over the full builtin
  keymap, palette `fuzzy_match` + full filter pass at 66/500/2000 items,
  and the session TOML round-trip for a 9-workspace layout. Runs in
  ~25s; criterion writes comparisons against the previous local run to
  `target/criterion/`.
- `cargo bench -p geode-demo-data` — the synthetic data generator
  (100k/1M rows), established in phase 0.
- `cargo bench --workspace --no-run` — CI compiles every bench on both
  platforms (the workspace-wide `bench = false` / `harness = false`
  invariants in CLAUDE.md keep criterion the only harness).

## Profiler support (`profiling` feature, off by default)

`cargo run -p geode-app --features profiling` enables gpui's own
`profiler` feature at the pinned rev (zed e3adf43) — hdrhistogram-backed
per-window draw/present and input-latency histograms, gpui's painted
debug frame overlay, and hang detection — plus two extra Diagnostics
actions registered only when compiled in:

- `perf::gpui_overlay` — cycles gpui's built-in frame overlay
  (Hidden → Minimal → Full).
- `perf::dump` — writes both measurement layers (the shell histogram and
  gpui's draw/dirty→present/present-interval histograms) to stderr.

Recorded decision: no Tracy client. gpui instruments through the
backend-less `profiling` facade crate; wiring Tracy would mean adding a
`tracy-client` dependency this workspace deliberately avoids. The only
dependency the feature adds is `hdrhistogram`, pulled in by gpui itself.
Verification for changes touching the feature:
`cargo check -p geode-app --features profiling` (not part of CI).
Release/bench profiles already keep debug symbols for external profilers
(workspace `Cargo.toml`, spec §7.4).

## Deferred to Phase 2: CI benchmark-regression gating

Spec §7.4's "CI fails on benchmark regression beyond threshold" is
deliberately not wired yet: the benches that the spec's budgets actually
gate on — the query/snapshot pipeline over 1M-row synthetic data — do
not exist until Phase 2 builds DataService, and thresholding the current
nanosecond-scale shell microbenches on shared CI runners would produce
noise-driven failures, not regression signal. When Phase 2 lands the
pipeline benches, add the gating step (criterion baselines checked
against a stored reference with a generous threshold) over those.

## Phase 2a: ingest benchmarks (`cargo bench -p geode-data`)

`benches/ingest.rs`, over the generated source directory (no checked-in
fixtures, spec §7.4). Measured on an M-series Mac, `--release`, DuckDB
1.10505 bundled. Numbers are the criterion median.

| Benchmark | Result |
|---|---|
| `ingest_warm_start/reopen_populated_db` | **5.0 ms** |
| `ingest_single_file/load_one_file` (~6k rows) | 237 ms (25.7 K rows/s) |
| `ingest_cold_start/100000_rows` | 2.93 s |
| `ingest_cold_start/1000000_rows` | 12.2 s |

Staging, sequential against four connections, at two file sizes:

| Rows per file (17 files) | Sequential | Parallel ×4 | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| 23,529 | 3.55 s | 1.32 s | 2.69× |
| 117,647 | 5.75 s | 3.07 s | **1.87×** |

**Warm start is the number that matters most.** Reopening a populated
database and querying `measures_position_live` takes 5 ms, so tiles paint
real data essentially immediately and the §7.1 one-second startup budget
never depends on reading a CSV. This is what amending §5.3 from in-memory
to persistent storage bought.

**Spec §5.6's open question is answered: parallel staging wins, by
1.87× at realistic file sizes.** The plan predicted parallelism would
*not* help, reasoning that DuckDB's CSV reader is already multi-threaded
and would saturate the cores by itself. The measurement says that
reasoning is directionally right but incomplete: the advantage does
shrink as files grow — 2.69× at 24k rows per file, 1.87× at 118k — yet
it is still worth nearly 2× at the size the desk's files actually run
to. Per-file fixed cost (below) is part of why: it is paid per file
regardless of file size, and parallelism hides it.

An earlier revision of this file claimed 2.76× and explained it as
intra-file parallelism "never" saturating the cores. That was measured
on ~18k-row files — far smaller than production — and the explanation
was too strong. The crossover where inter-file parallelism stops paying
was not located; it lies above 118k rows per file, and finding it needs
a fixture larger than is practical to generate in memory.

The ingest runner ships single-threaded (correct, and matching §5.3's
single-writer constraint for *publishes*); moving staging onto a worker
pool while keeping publishes serialized is the measured next
optimization.

**Per-file fixed cost dominates small files.** A load runs `read_csv`,
one grouped split per grain, and one publish transaction per grain — so
a ~6k-row file costs 237 ms, most of it fixed. This is why cold start
scales closer to file count than to row count, and it is the second
reason parallel staging helps so much.

Not yet gated in CI. The §7.4 regression gate wants a stored criterion
baseline and a generous threshold; these numbers are the first baseline
worth storing.
